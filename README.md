## Run the Front End

  ##Step 1: run npm install

  Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
  *This used to be ng serve, however we had to switch to npm start inorder to engage the proxy server.*

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
